# Audio Embeddings
This repository contains example workflows, READMEs, sample data, and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) files that facilitate the usage of various open-source voice feature extraction packages, tools, datasets, and models for generating audio embeddings.

It is a part of a larger [toolkit](https://github.com/FHS-BAP/Voice-Feature-Extraction-Toolkit/) was developed to support scientific research surrounding investigations of relationships between brain aging and voice features, although the extraction of voice features does have wider applicability. We invite others to please offer their questions, ideas, feedback, and improvements on this repository.
